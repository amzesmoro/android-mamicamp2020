## TimeFighter
On TimeFighter there are some challenge that RayWenderlich gives namely (Produce A Todo List):
* Add a "Tap Me" button
* Add Text for the game score
* Add Text for the time left
* When you tap the button, the game starts and the timer counts down
* Tapping the button again increments the scores
* When the timer reaches zero (from 60s to 0s), show the score and reset the game
* When the phone is held in landscape mode, rotate the game (it should look nice)
